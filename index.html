                Nathan "Nate" Drake is an American treasure-hunter and explorer said to be a descendant of the legendary British explorer <em>Sir Francis Drake</em>.
                 Nate's mother killed herself while Nate was young, and Nate's father surrendered him to the state when Nate was 5 years old.</p>
                  <p>Nate was entrusted to the St. Francis boys home for some time, before he began a life on the streets.
                  Nate first meets his mentor Victor "Sully" Sullivan when he is 14, on the streets of Cartagena, Colombia.
                   Nate is attempting to steal Francis Drake's ring from an exhibition at a Cartagena museum when he spots Sully acting suspiciously.</p>
                    <p>Nate follows Sully through the streets of Cartagena and watches Sully receive a key that will grant him access to the display case holding Drake's ring.
                     Nate is later able to take the key for himself and attempts to steal the ring.
                      However, as he is taking the ring Sully and Katherine Marlowe enter the exhibit.</p>
                       <p>Marlowe slaps Nate when he refuses to give him the ring, but Sully stops her from slapping him a second time.
                        Nate takes this opportunity to escape the museum with the ring, although he is pursued by Marlowe's agents.
                         However, Sully aids Nate by subduing the agents and later takes him to a bar, where he offers to teach Nate some things about the criminal life he leads.
                          Nate agrees, and Sully says that he sees great things in their future.</p>
